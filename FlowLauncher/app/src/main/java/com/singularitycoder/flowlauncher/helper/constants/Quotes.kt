            This makes sense. Peace does not come from cooperation but actually by a simple show of might.
            The law of the jungle applies everywhere. It is simply wrapped with niceties and sophistry when dealing with humans. 
            Peace acquired through cooperation will only be temporary.
            In the scriptures it is said that we living entities are put in this material world because 
            we wanted to imitate Lord Krishna. But since there can only be one king in the spiritual world, this material world
            was created for us to imitate Him. We see this happening even now. 
            When 2 parties within a state fight with each other, the government decides to split the land to create new rulers.
            So basically everyone wants to be a king, everyone wants to dominate others.
            This happens on all scales both small and big from nations to families. The world is full of hierarchies. And a well defined hierarchy is a peaceful structure.
            To seek equality is probably not sensible because there is no such thing as equality. Everybody is different and are born in different circumstances.
            Even if all of them were provided equal resources, some people just know how to use them better. The end goal being control.
            When everyone wants to control, that is when peace is disturbed.
            And the only way to fix that is by the sheer use of overwhelming power.
            So lasting peace can only come from absolute dominance. A central figure powerful enough to subdue them all.
            In the olden days there were longer periods of peace because the kings were powerful.
            Of course there is no such thing as lasting or permanent in this material world because of strong men, weak men quote (Line 289). 
            This makes sense because if a king stayed forever, others wont get the chance to experience being a king. 
            So based on karma and other instruments like death, each of them get a chance to experience being a king at different levels. Basically a realtime RPG.
            On that note, punishment is also a good instrument of control. The ability to instill fear in the wrong doers can also maintain peace.
            This is assuming the ruler is righteous and knows the difference btw good and bad. But then who decides what is good and bad? 
            Definitely not humans. No human or a group has the capacity to understand all the nuances of the world, of every other human and every other living entity.
            We are fundamentally biased from birth. Being biased is our default state.
