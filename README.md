# Flow-Launcher
Stay in the flow and achieve more!

## Concept
Core idea is iOS style work, home, etc profiles with only related apps visible in that profile. Apps, Clock, Profile name will be in the center screen. On right swipe we get weather, news headlines, etc scraped from top sources. On left swipe you will have 4 or 5 pre launched apps in foreground ready to use - like My Mind for notes, Remind Me for reminders, etc. Just like widgets but in reality just apps that never get killed until device gets killed. Not sure how to avoid an app from getting killed from task switcher though.
